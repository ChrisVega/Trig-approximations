# Trig-approximations
I made this to help me understand Taylor series while studying for my calculus 2 final so it is a bit bare bones since I was focused on the algorithims.

All approximations will be accuarate up to 8 decimal places according to wolfram alpha. Approximations are calculated using Taylor series for Sin and Cos and manipulating them when need. For example Csc is 1/the Taylor series of Sin.
